# Rabbits-Lions-in-MIPS-ASM
This project is based off a simulation style game I'd encountered in a C++ course I took in my sophomore year of university. The premise of the game is simple, a 32X32 game board is filled with five potential values corresponding to an empty space, stone, food, rabbit, or lion. Stones cannot be moved onto, empty spaces and food behave the same, lions and rabbits can not move onto spaces of the same kind but they can move onto spaces of the opposite species. Each individual entity can only move by one space per round, and at the end of each round, the game checks to see how many of each entity are on the gameboard. Rounds are played as follows: the game visits each tile on the 32 x 32 game board, left to right and top to bottom, then checks the value stored at that tile. If the value is either 13 (rabbit) or 14 (lion), the game then branches to a decision tree that starts off with a 5% chance of unwriting the entity at the location immediately and skipping to the next tile. If the entity survives, the game will load the X and Y positions of the surrounding tiles in all eight cardinal directions - plus itself, into an array. The entity will then determine which tile to write itself to, unwrite itself from the current tile, and return from the decision tree. at the end of each tile turn, the game will redraw all 9 tiles onto the display. This continues until the round concludes, when the game reaches the max X and Y positions on the gameboard. If there are none of either the lion, rabbit, or both on gameboard, the game exit condition is met and the program concludes - otherwise, the X and Y indexes are reset and another round is played.

## How To Run This Game:
The easiest way to run this game is to use the MARS MIPS Simulator/IDE, which I've included purely for convenience (All credit to Kenneth Volmer and Pete Sanderson at Missouri State University). MARS is a Java Executable and thus requires the user to have a somewhat recent version of the Java Runtime Environment. In MARS, after opening the LIFE_GAME.asm file, go to Tools > Bitmap Display on the top menu bar. Keeping a 1 unit per 256px scaling factor (ie, unit width 2, display width 512px) and a square gameboard, click "Connect to Mips" on the bottom left of the bitmap display menu. Then at the top menu, select Run > Assemble and then Run > Go. It is recommended to restart MARS after running the simulation two or three times, as the IDE has an unaddressed memory leak that causes performance issues for the simualation after a few runs.
